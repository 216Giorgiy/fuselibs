## SwipeGesture
- A `Simple` or `Auto` `SwipeGesture` will no longer automatically activate at the halfway point, whereas a `Active` gesture will.  To get the old default behavior, which is considered a defect, use `Threshold="0.5"`.
- Added a `SwipeGesture.Threshold` to configure the automatic activation distnace.
