# Examples

## Text properties

```
<Text Color="#999">Left</Text>
<Text TextAlignment="Center">Center</Text>
<Text FontSize="24" TextAlignment="Right">Right</Text>
<Text LineSpacing="10">
Multiple
Lines
</Text>
```

In this example, the first text element will be left aligned as this is the default, and have its color set to a medium light grey. The second text will be center aligned. The third will be right aligned and have a larger font. The fourth will span two lines with 10 points of space inbetween.
